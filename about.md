# About
Computer Science student at University of Porto, for professional information please 
take a look at my Curriculum Vitae.

Video game enthusiast currently striving to pursue a career in game development.

## Interests
### Video Games
I blame my uncle for this addiction, since he introduced me to the medium with an old Atari 
one christmas night.

Throughout the years I've seen the industry growing and the stigma around it shrinking, 
I wish to be able to create experiences such as those that helped me grow and define 
what I am now.

### Music
Progressive, industrial and experimental.

Was able to see God Speed You Black Emperor! live, it was by a long shot, the best concert 
I ever gone to.

### Movies
Anything ridiculously bad. Watching funny bad movies has become something of a ritual 
between me and friends.

### GNU/Linux
Sometimes I feel I spend more time perfecting my workflow than really working.

The power of free as in freedom.
