# About
Computer Science student at University of Porto, for professional information please 
take a look at my Curriculum Vitae.

Video game enthusiast currently striving to pursue a career in game development.

## Interests
### Video Games
For many an addiction, but for those who play, a tremendously powerful medium.

Throughout the years I've seen the industry growing and the stigma around it shrinking, 
I wish to be able to create experiences such as those that helped me grow and define 
what I am now.

Favourites are Sly Cooper 2, MGS: Peace Walker and GTA: Vice City.

### Music
Progressive, industrial and experimental.

Go and listen to God Speed You Black Emperor!.

### Movies
Anything ridiculously bad.

### GNU/Linux
Sometimes I feel I spend more time perfecting my workflow than really working.

The power of free as in freedom.
